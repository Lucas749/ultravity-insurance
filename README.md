# ultravity-insurance
Transaction based insurance built on top of Ultravity.

Users can insure single transactions based on the simulation outcome. If deviations to the shown outcome occur, users get their insurance cover paid out instantly. Capital is provided by permissionless vaults where users can stake WBIT to collect insurance premiums. Users can choose between multiple pools with distinct risks/return characteristics.
